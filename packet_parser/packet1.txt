phenomenon still occurs even when it's explicitly explained to people in "open label" schemes. A portmanteau of the word "no" and the name of this phenomenon has been theorized to cause many COVID vaccine (*)  adverse events and is a form of social learning. In double- blind research studies, this 
phenomenon is typically observed in the response of the control group. For 10 points, name this effect where subjects given a "sham" sugar pill might feel better.

Chengyang example. In 1587, Antonio da Ponte won a competition to design one of these structures that required 6,000 timber piles to be driven into the ground.

6. Porphyrin compounds exhibit an intense absorption peak in this color of the spectrum called a Soret 
("so-RAY")  band. CRY1 and CRY2 code for proteins called cryptochromes which use light of this color for 
entrainment. A twisted form of the carotenoid asta·xanthin causes about one in two million lobsters to appear this color. Animals that appear green or this color rarely do so due to pigments and are more likely to exhibit structural coloration, as seen in the wings of the butterfly Morpho didius . Human (*)  eyes 
which appear this color contain little melanin, which normally blocks Rayleigh scattering. S- cones percei ve this 
color due to its shorter wavelength in the visible spectrum. For 10 points, name this color of jays in the genus Cyanocitta 
("sie -uh-noe-SI-tuh") .

inversely proportional to frequency. The time constant equals (*)  resistance times the characteristic quantity
